Vite provides a modern and highly efficient alternative to **Create React App (CRA)**. Here are some key reasons why you should choose Vite for your React projects:

## Steps of Implementation:

1. **Step 1: Install Vite:**
   First, you need to install the Vite development environment. The recommended way is to use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```
This command initializes a new React project with Vite as the bundler. Vite automatically configures the necessary tooling and file structure.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to your project directory and install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
or 
npm i
```

This will install node modules.

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- This will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000 (by default). Any changes made to your React components will be reflected instantly in the browser.

## Why Vite Over CRA (Create React App)?

- **Faster development** server due to ESBuild and no bundling in development.
- **Better performance** and more efficient use of resources.
- **Strict mode** catches potential issues early and enforces modern coding standards.
- **Minimal configuration:** Vite works out of the box for most use cases, requiring little to no setup.
- **Better tooling:** Vite supports modern JavaScript, TypeScript, and ES modules natively, ensuring a future-proof development environment.

Vite provides a modern alternative to Create React App, focusing on speed, simplicity, and developer experience. It’s particularly well-suited for large applications and modern web development practices.

## Explaination of Entry Point in Vite

1. **Default Behavior in Vite:**

By default, Vite assumes that index.html is the entry HTML file for your project. This is because index.html is the typical convention for HTML files in web projects. When you run vite or npm run dev, Vite will:

Look for a file called index.html in the root directory of the project.
This HTML file will be used to serve the initial page of the application and includes references to the entry JavaScript file (like main.js or main.ts).
Here’s what happens under the hood:

Vite automatically scans this index.html file, inserts appropriate script tags, and processes the linked JavaScript files.

2. **Configuring Vite to Use a Custom Entry HTML File(Different name):**

In case you want to specify a different HTML file (not index.html), you can configure the Vite build options to point to it. Vite’s configuration allows you to define a custom entry point HTML file for both development and production builds.

Here’s how you can configure a custom HTML file in vite.config.js:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default {
  root: './src',  // This specifies the root directory for Vite (if you want to change it from default).
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      input: 'src/custom.html',  // Specify the custom HTML file here
    }
  }
}
```
