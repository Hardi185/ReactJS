## Library Example (React):
____________________________
Imagine you’re building a house, and you have a toolbox full of tools (like a hammer, saw, and screwdriver).
- You decide which tool to use, when to use it, and in what order to work on tasks.
- You have full control, but you also have to know which tools are right for each job and how to use them effectively.

**In this analogy:**
- The toolbox is like a library: it provides useful tools, but you’re in charge of using them however you want.


## Framework Example (Angular):
_______________________________

Now, imagine you’re working with a house-building kit. This kit includes all the parts (walls, roof, floors), and it also comes with a detailed instruction manual that tells you exactly how to put the house together.
- The kit provides a predefined structure, so you follow specific steps to assemble the house.
- The kit has a set way of doing things: you’re adding your own touches, but it dictates the overall flow.
In this analogy:
- The house-building kit is like a framework: it gives you the structure and tells you how to proceed, directing the overall process.

So, with a library, you have tools, and you’re the boss of the workflow. With a framework, you follow a specific guide, and the framework dictates much of the workflow.


Summary: With a library (React), you control when functions are called and organize the app structure. 
With a framework (Angular), the framework defines the structure and controls much of the flow, calling your code at predetermined points.
