## Steps to Implement a React Bundler

1. **Install Node.js and npm**  
   Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed. They provide the environment and tools for managing packages and running scripts.

2. **Create a React App**  
   Use the `create-react-app` command to set up a new React project with a pre-configured bundler (Webpack).  

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app

3. **Understand the Structure**
- src/index.js: The entry point of the application where React starts rendering.
- public/index.html: The HTML file where your React app is injected.
- src/App.js: The main component of the application.

4. **Run the Development Server**

```bash
npm start
or
npm run start
```

NOTE: **Build for Production:**

```bash
npm run build
```
This command optimizes and bundles the code for production, generating a build folder.

---

## How It Works
Entry Point: The src/index.js file serves as the entry point. It renders the root component (App.js) into the div with the ID root in public/index.html. Webpack, the bundler used by create-react-app, identifies this entry point automatically.

Example: src/index.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
it's not mandatory to name the file index.js, but it's conventionally named so in most React projects because:

Webpack Default Behavior: Webpack (used by create-react-app) considers index.js as the default entry point in the src folder if not explicitly specified in its configuration.
Simplifies Imports: If a folder contains an index.js file, you can import from the folder directly without specifying the file name.

## What is npm run build and npm run start?

**npm run start:**
- Starts the development server.
- Runs on localhost:3000 by default.
- Watches for file changes and reloads the browser.

**npm run build:**
- Creates an optimized production-ready build.
- Outputs minified files in the build folder for deployment.

---

## What is React.StrictMode?

- A development tool that highlights potential problems in an application.
- Wraps components in React.StrictMode to check for:
   -    Unsafe lifecycle methods.
   -    Deprecated APIs.
   -    Side effects during rendering.

```javascript
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```

**What Happens If You Donâ€™t Use React.StrictMode?**

- **No Alerts for Problems:** Without React.StrictMode, the application runs as normal, but you won't be notified of potential issues that might cause problems in the future.
- **No Deprecation Warnings:** Deprecated methods or unsafe practices won't trigger warnings.
- **Missed Optimization Opportunities:** You might unintentionally use patterns or APIs that hinder performance, especially with modern features like concurrent rendering.
- inshort no warning messages

Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  if (count === 0) {
    setCount(1); // Directly mutating state during rendering
  }

  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
}
```

Console Warning:
```vbnet
Warning: Cannot update state during a render phase. This will cause unexpected behavior in strict mode.
```

Fix for this warning:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (count === 0) {
      setCount(1); // Update state inside useEffect (side effect)
    }
  }, [count]); // This effect will run when 'count' changes

  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
}
```

- **useEffect Hook:** The useEffect hook allows you to run side effects (like updating the state) after the component has rendered. This ensures that state changes do not happen during the render phase and avoid triggering unnecessary re-renders.

- The second argument to useEffect is an array of dependencies. In this case, useEffect will run every time the count state changes. The state update inside useEffect will only happen once when count is 0, as the condition if (count === 0) will be met.
  
- The setCount(1) will execute inside the useEffect, ensuring that React follows its rules for side effects and the component works as expected.

- **NOTE:** We'll learn about useEffect and other hooks afterwards.
