## Steps to Implement a React Bundler

1. **Install Node.js and npm**  
   Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed. They provide the environment and tools for managing packages and running scripts.

2. **Create a React App**  
   Use the `create-react-app` command to set up a new React project with a pre-configured bundler (Webpack).  

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
