# Tailwind CSS

This project demonstrates the basic configuration and usage of Tailwind CSS, which provides predefined utility classes to simplify and speed up CSS implementation.

## Implementation Steps:

If you have created your ReactJS project using Vite, follow these steps:

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**:  
   Run the following commands in your project directory to install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```
   This creates a tailwind.config.js file for your project.

2. **Configure Tailwind CSS:**
   Open the tailwind.config.js file and update the content property to include your source files:
   ```javascript
       module.exports = {
      content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    };
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind Directives:**
   In your src/index.css or any global CSS file, include the Tailwind CSS directives:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

4. **Start Your Development Server:**
   Run your development server using:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```
