# Context API:

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of how the Context API works in React. Before diving into the code, I recommend familiarizing yourself with the concept of Context API by reading through this [Context API Guide](https://github.com/Hardi185/ReactJS/blob/main/Context%20API.md).
