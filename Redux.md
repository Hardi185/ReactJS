## What is Redux?
Redux is a state management library commonly used with JavaScript applications (especially with React). It provides a predictable state container to manage the applicationâ€™s global state. Redux helps manage complex state transitions in a consistent and testable manner, making it easier to scale applications.

## Key Concepts in Redux

<a id="1-store"></a>
1. **Store:**

- The single source of truth for the application's state.
- A central place where the entire state of the application resides.
- Only one store per application.
- Created using the createStore or configureStore method.

- Example:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer, // Combines all slices
});
```

- If we've multiple slice and thier reducers, we can right as
```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import todoReducer from './todoSlice';
import userReducer from './userSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    todos: todoReducer, // The 'todos' slice (todos string should match with value of name key in slice)
    users: userReducer, // The 'users' slice
  },
});

export default store;
```
- Wrap Your App with the Provider

```javascript

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <TODO />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```

<a id="2-slice"></a>
2. **Slice:**

- Slices manage a specific part of the state and include both reducers and actions.
- A slice is a collection of Redux logic for a single feature or state domain (e.g., a "todos" slice).
- Defined using the createSlice function in Redux Toolkit.
- Example:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const todoSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'todos',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    addTodo: (state, action) => {
      state.push(action.payload);
    },
    removeTodo: (state, action) => {
      return state.filter(todo => todo.id !== action.payload);
    },
  },
});

export const { addTodo, removeTodo } = todoSlice.actions;
export default todoSlice.reducer;
```

<a id="3-reducer"></a>
3. **Reducer:**

- A pure function that specifies how the state should change in response to an action.
- Each slice has its own reducer generated automatically by createSlice.

<a id="4-selector"></a>
4. **Selector:**

- Functions used to extract specific pieces of data from the Redux store.
- Example:

```javascript
export const selectTodos = state => state.todos;
```

<a id="5-dispatch"></a>
5. **Dispatch:**

- A method used to send actions to the Redux store, triggering the reducer to update the state.
- Example:

```javascript
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { addTodo } from './todoSlice';

const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(addTodo({ id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux' }));
```

## Installation Steps:

- **React Redux:** Provides bindings for React and Redux, enabling components to access and interact with the Redux store easily.
- **@reduxjs/toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is a library designed to simplify the process of managing state in applications using Redux. Simplifies Redux setup with utilities like configureStore, createSlice, and built-in best practices (e.g., immutability and middleware setup).

To install React Redux and @reduxjs/toolkit using npm, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit

```

## Redux vs Context API

When using the React Context API, any change in the value of a context causes all components that consume that context to re-render, regardless of whether the change affects them directly. This is because React Context doesn't have a built-in mechanism to determine which specific consumers need updates.

### Example of Performance Issues with Context
Imagine a scenario where you have a simple app with two components:
- A **ThemeSwitcher** that toggles between light and dark themes.
- A **UserProfile** component that displays user details.

Both components consume the same context: `AppContext`.

1. **Create the Context:**

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

export const AppContext = createContext();

export function AppProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 });

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
  };

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme, user }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

2. **Consuming Context in Components:**
- **ThemeSwitcher Component:**

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { AppContext } from './AppProvider';

function ThemeSwitcher() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(AppContext);

  console.log('ThemeSwitcher rendered');

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Switch to {theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode
    </button>
  );
}

export default ThemeSwitcher;

```

- **UserProfile Component:**

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { AppContext } from './AppProvider';

function UserProfile() {
  const { user } = useContext(AppContext);

  console.log('UserProfile rendered');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>Age: {user.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;
```

3. **Wrapping the app:**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { AppProvider } from './AppProvider';
import ThemeSwitcher from './ThemeSwitcher';
import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

function App() {
  return (
    <AppProvider>
      <ThemeSwitcher />
      <UserProfile />
    </AppProvider>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

```

**Observing the Problem**

 1. Open the browser console.
 2. Click the "Switch to dark mode" button in the `ThemeSwitcher` component.

**Issue**

- Both ThemeSwitcher and UserProfile re-render, even though the user value remains unchanged.
- This happens because AppContext.Provider re-renders whenever its value prop changes (due to the theme state update), and all consuming components are notified.

```bash
ThemeSwitcher rendered
UserProfile rendered
```

**Why Does This Happen?**

The AppContext.Provider creates a new value object on every render:

```javascript
value={{ theme, toggleTheme, user }}
```
Since this object is re-created, React assumes the context has changed, causing all consumers to re-render.

Although, To avoid unnecessary re-renders, you can split the context or use memorization but redux is better.

### Why Redux Solves This Issue

Redux uses a selector pattern to optimize re-renders. With Redux, only components that rely on the specific piece of state being updated will re-render. Other components remain unaffected, which addresses the performance bottlenecks of React Context.

**Example in Redux:**
- **ThemeSwitcher** will subscribe to `theme` in the Redux store.
- **UserProfile** will subscribe to `user`.

State updates in Redux are more granular because subscriptions are scoped to the specific data pieces a component depends on.

### Comparison Table: Context API vs Redux

| Feature            | Context API                                   | Redux                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **State Management** | Good for light or static state.              | Suitable for complex, dynamic states.   |
| **Performance**     | Re-renders all consuming components when the value changes. | Efficient with selective state updates. |
| **Debugging**       | No built-in debugging tools.                  | Provides tools like Redux DevTools.     |
| **Middleware Support** | Limited capabilities.                     | Supports middleware for async logic.    |
| **Scalability**     | Not ideal for large applications.            | Designed for large-scale apps.          |
