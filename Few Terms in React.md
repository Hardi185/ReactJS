# Important terms in React:

## what is re-render term:

A re-render in React occurs when a component's output (its JSX or DOM) needs to be recalculated and updated in the browser. React does this to ensure the UI stays in sync with the application's state or props.

## what is react dom

ReactDOM acts as the bridge between React components and the DOM (Document Object Model).

- React, by itself, is not directly manipulating the DOM. React creates a virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. It compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM (a process known as "reconciliation") to figure out which parts of the UI need to be updated.
- ReactDOM handles the rendering of React components into the actual DOM. When React components change (e.g., due to state or props updates), ReactDOM ensures that only the necessary changes are made to the DOM, optimizing performance and minimizing unnecessary updates.

**In short:**

- React manages and updates the state and UI components.
- ReactDOM is responsible for rendering the React components into the actual DOM and handling the updates efficiently.

## what is Fragement:

In React, each component must return a single root element. In many cases, however, you might want to return multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in a parent container like a `div`. If you use `div` just to group elements, it can unnecessarily add extra nodes to the DOM and make your HTML structure more complex.

**Why use a Fragment?**

- **No Extra DOM Elements:** Fragments allow you to return multiple elements from a component without adding an extra parent node to the DOM. This keeps the DOM cleaner.
- **Better Semantics:** You don't clutter the HTML structure with unnecessary wrapper elements like `div` or `span`.
- Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function List() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Items List</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

```

In this case, `<>` and `</>` (shorthand for `React.Fragment`) allow you to group elements without introducing extra elements in the DOM. The result will just be the h2 and ul tags.

---

## what is prop:

**Props** (short for properties) are how data is passed from one component to another in React. They are read-only and allow parent components to pass information to child components.

Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
}

export default App;
```

**In this example:**
- The `App` component passes the `name` prop to the `Greeting` component.
- The `Greeting` component receives the `name` prop and displays it.

## Functional Components vs Class Components in React

## 1. Syntax

### Functional Component
A simple JavaScript function that returns JSX.
```jsx
// Functional Component
const Hello = () => {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};
```

### Class Component
A JavaScript class that extends React.Component and includes a `render()` method.
```jsx
// Class Component
class Hello extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    }
}
```


## 2. State Handling

### Functional Component
Uses `useState` hook to manage state.
```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
};
```

### Class Component
Uses `this.state` and `setState()`.
```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
                Count: {this.state.count}
            </button>
        );
    }
}
```

## 3. Lifecycle Methods

### Functional Component
Uses hooks like `useEffect()` to handle lifecycle events.
```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

const Example = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("Component Mounted");
        return () => console.log("Component Unmounted");
    }, []);
    return <p>Example</p>;
};
```

### Class Component
Uses lifecycle methods.
```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        console.log("Component Mounted");
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
        console.log("Component Unmounted");
    }

    render() {
        return <p>Example</p>;
    }
}
```


## 4. Performance
- Functional components are generally more lightweight and faster due to no class instantiation.
- Class components may have slightly higher memory usage due to method bindings.


## 5. Code Readability & Maintainability
- Functional components are shorter and easier to read.
- Class components require more boilerplate code.


## 6. React Hooks (Introduced in React 16.8)
- Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc., make functional components more powerful.
- Previously, class components were necessary for stateful logic, but hooks allow functional components to replace class components in most cases.


## 7. Use Cases
- **Functional Components**: Preferred for most cases due to simplicity and hooks support.
- **Class Components**: Still exist in legacy projects but are generally avoided in new code.

## Key Takeaways

‚úÖ Functional Components (Preferred):
- Wrapped in a function.
- Uses hooks for state and lifecycle.
- Shorter, more readable, and performant.


‚ùå Class Components (Legacy):
- Wrapped in a class extending React.Component.
- Uses this.state and lifecycle methods.
- More boilerplate code and less efficient.

üëâ Conclusion: Class components still exist in older projects but are rarely used in modern React development. Functional components with hooks are the recommended approach! üöÄ
